# Investments Calculator

## About

This simple React app is made so that one can easily calculate the compund interest if they chose to invest some of their yearly savings each year.

## How is works

Current Savings: Here you should add the amount of money you have already saved throughout the years or in other words the cash money u have in your bank account.

Yearly Savings: here you should add (on average) the amount of money you expect to save each year for the duration of the investment.

Expected Interest: Depending on the type of your invenstment you should have an idea how much percentage interest you are expecting per year. These investments can vary greatly (ie. gold, buying real estate, bonds, investment certificates etc...)

Investment Duration: Self explanatory. How long do you want this abount of money to keep being reinvested every year.
